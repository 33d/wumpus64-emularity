# Welcome to the Emularity #

# Synopsis #

The goal of this little project is to make it easy to embed a
javascript-based emulator in your own webpage. It downloads the files
you specify (with aprogress ui to show what is happening), arranges
them to form a filesystem, constructs the necessary arguments for the
emulator, and handles transitions to and from full-screen mode.

To use this project you'll need to provide it with a canvas element,
styled as necessary so that it has the correct size on screen (the
emulated program will be scaled up automatically to fit, controlling
for aspect ratio). You will also likely want to provide a simple UI
for entering full-screen mode or muting the audio; these can simply
call methods on the emulator when activated.

# The Emulators #

Currently works with two emulators:

## JSMESS ##

[JSMESS](https://github.com/jsmess/jsmess) is a port of the Multi
Emulator Super System (MESS) and the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator
(MAME) projects to Javascript. MESS and MAME support hundreds of
different machines; producing a single javascript file which supports
all of them turns out to be infeasible. Instead the JSMESS developers
have split each machine out into a separate js file.

## EM-DOSBox ##

[EM-DOSBox](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox/) is a port of
DosBox to Javascript. DOSBox emulates an IBM PC compatible running
DOS. There are two versions of this emulator, dosbox.js and
dosbox-sync.js. Use the former by default, and the latter if you need
the emulator to support console input, batch files, or programs that
run other programs.

# Emulator API #

The `Emulator` constructor takes three arguments: a canvas element, an
optional callback (which will be called after fully initializing the
emulator but just before it starts running the emulated program), and
a config (as detailed below) or a function which returns a `Promise`
of a config.

# Configuration #

## Examples ##

### Arcade game ###

Loads the emulator for the arcade game 1943, and gives it a compressed
copy of the rom (which it loads from examples/1943.zip).

      var emulator = new Emulator(document.querySelector("#canvas"),
                                  null,
                                  new JSMAMELoader(JSMAMELoader.driver("1943"),
                                                   JSMAMELoader.nativeResolution(224, 256),
                                                   JSMAMELoader.emulatorJS("emulators/mess1943.js"),
                                                   JSMAMELoader.mountFile("1943.zip",
                                                                          JSMAMELoader.fetchFile("Game File",
                                                                                                 "examples/1943.zip"))))
      emulator.setScale(3);
      emulator.start({ waitAfterDownloading: true });

### Console game for Atari 2600 ###

Loads the emulator for the Atari 2600 console, and an image of a
catridge for Pitfall. Notice how we download the image, storing it in
a file, then set up a "cart" peripheral so that the emulator can find
it. We also load a configuration file that preconfigures some
keybindings needed to use the 2600.

      var emulator = new Emulator(document.querySelector("#canvas"),
                                  null,
                                  new JSMESSLoader(JSMESSLoader.driver("a2600"),
                                                   JSMESSLoader.nativeResolution(352, 223),
                                                   JSMESSLoader.emulatorJS("emulators/messa2600.js"),
                                                   JSMESSLoader.mountFile("Pitfall_Activision_1982.bin",
                                                                          JSMESSLoader.fetchFile("Game File",
                                                                                                 "examples/Pitfall_Activision_1982.bin")),
                                                   JSMESSLoader.mountFile("a2600.cfg",
                                                                          JSMESSLoader.fetchFile("Config File",
                                                                                                 "examples/a2600.cfg")),
                                                   JSMESSLoader.peripheral("cart", "Pitfall_Activision_1982.bin")))
      emulator.setScale(3).start({ waitAfterDownloading: true });

### DOS game ###

Here we load the dosbox emulator, and a zip file containing the game
ZZT which we decompress and then mount as the C drive. We also tell
DosBox to immediately start running zzt.exe, which is inside the zip.

      var emulator = new Emulator(document.querySelector("#canvas"),
                                  null,
                                  new DosBoxLoader(DosBoxLoader.emulatorJS("emulators/dosbox.js"),
                                                   DosBoxLoader.nativeResolution(640, 400),
                                                   DosBoxLoader.mountZip("c",
                                                                         DosBoxLoader.fetchFile("Game File",
                                                                                                "examples/Zzt_1991_Epic_Megagames_Inc.zip")),
                                                   DosBoxLoader.startExe("zzt.exe")))
      emulator.start({ waitAfterDownloading: true });

## Configuration API ##

Currently there are two supported emulators, JSMESS and
EM-DosBox. JSMESS provides emulation for arcade games, consoles, and
early personal computers. As this emulator supports such a wide
variety of hardware it has been broken up into several dozen emulators
each supporting one machine lest the resulting javascript be
intractably large (60+ megabytes). EM-DosBox provides emulation for
software that runs on x86 PCs using the DOS operating systems common
to the era.

Each of these is configured by calling a constructor function and
providing it with arguments formed by calling static methods on that
same constructor.

### Common ###

* `emulatorJS(url)`
* `mountZip(drive, file)`
* `mountFile(filename, file)`
* `fetchFile(url)`
* `fetchOptionalFile(url)`
* `localFile(data)`

### JSMESS ###

* `driver(driverName)`
* `extraArgs(args)`
* `peripheral(name, filename)`

### JSMAME ###

* `driver(driverName)`
* `extraArgs(args)`

### EM-DosBox ###

* `startExe(filename)`

## Internet Archive ##

There's also a helper for loading software from
[the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/v2), `IALoader`. IALoader
looks at the metadata associated with an Internet Archive item and
uses that to build the configuration for the emulator.

## Examples ##

    var emulator = new IALoader(document.querySelector("#canvas"),
                                "Pitfall_Activision_1982/Pitfall_Activision_1982.bin");

# Runtime API #

Once you have an emulator object, there are several methods you can call.

* `start()`
* `requestFullScreen()`
* `mute()`
* `setSplashColors()`
* othersâ€¦

# Known Bugs #

* documentation is quite poor
* splash screen doesn't always fit inside the canvas
* need to improve the download progress indicators
* browser feature detection for volume/mute/full-screen
* handling of aspect ratios, and their interaction with full-screen mode
* finish API for volume/mute/full-screen requests
