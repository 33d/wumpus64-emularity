Rough start on a TODO list:

            <db48x> I've gotta do the IA logo at some point
            <SketchCow> Right, we didn't get to my requests!
            <SketchCow> 1. MAME logo still is the default.
    [01:41] <SketchCow> 2. Keyboard acts weird in some places (this might be tracey)
            <SketchCow> 3. Fullscreen slows things down (this might be tracey)
    [01:42] <SketchCow> 4. Going out of fullscreen and it's brokey/small (this also might be tracey)
            <SketchCow> I'm probably forgetting something.
