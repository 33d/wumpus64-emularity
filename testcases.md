    [19:14] <db48x> if you've got a list then I'll be happy to run through it
    [19:15] <SketchCow> Yeah, I think that's smart going forward.
            <SketchCow> https://archive.org/details/arcade_astrob
    [19:16] <SketchCow> Tests: Works with arcade machine, presentation
    [19:17] <SketchCow> https://archive.org/details/sg_Wiz_n_Liz_1993_Psygnosis_US 
            <SketchCow> Tests: Game Console (Sega Genesis), Very intense processing needs
    [19:18] <SketchCow> https://archive.org/details/a2_Castle_Smurfenstein_1981_Dead_Smurf_cr
            <SketchCow> Tests: Apple II performance (computer), sound
    [19:19] <SketchCow> https://archive.org/details/msdos_Wolfenstein_3D_1992
            <SketchCow> Tests: EM-DOSBOX Side, sound, etc.
            <db48x> also parrallel file loads in Smurfenstein
            <SketchCow> So, at the VERY LEAST
            <SketchCow> These all shouldwork
            <SketchCow> If something blows up, there's something wrong.
    [19:20] <SketchCow> That's a solid test set. 
            <SketchCow> Obviously, Dragon's Lair is our go-to for "holy fuck, large ROM"
    [20:31] <db48x> I'm going to add snack attack to that list, since it's easy to tell when it's running too fast
    [01:51] <SketchCow> Yes!
